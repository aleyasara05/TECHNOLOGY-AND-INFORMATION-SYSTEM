# ASSIGNMENT 3: INDUSTRY-TALK-2

On 18 December 2025, I attended my second industrial talk, organised by Serunai Commerce Sdn Bhd. The session was delivered by Ts. Hj. Abdul Alim bin Abdul Muttalib,
the Head of Technology and Innovation. It was an insightful talk that provided a deeper understanding of the realities of working in the technology industry.

The speaker emphasised the importance of project management and system development in the field of computer science. While technical skills such as coding are important, 
he explained that strong project management knowledge is equally essential for long-term career development.This helped me realise that successful systems are not built on
programming skills alone, but also on proper planning, coordination, and management.

During the session, I gained a clearer understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and its different stages. The speaker also explained the differences between 
agile and waterfall methodologies,using real-life scenarios to make the concepts easier to understand. These examples helped me see how each methodology is applied in real projects
depending on requirements and constraints.

Overall, the talk was engaging and informative. It provided valuable insights into the industry and helped me connect what I have learned in my studies with real-world practices. 
I am grateful for the opportunity to attend this session, as it increased my awareness of the skills needed to succeed in the technology field.
