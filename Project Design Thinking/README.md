# Project Design Thinking

I participated in a group presentation related to our design thinking project, which centered on the development of the student face scan system. This
project became an important learning experience for me as, by working on this project, I gained an understanding of how technology can be utilized to
create an effective solution to real-world issues related to campus security and attendance management. By completing this project, my knowledge of facial
recognition systems is not only thorough, but I am also aware of their uses in educational settings.

Throughout the design thinking process, I have learned the importance of adopting a user-centered design. This involved considering the needs of both students
and staff to ensure that the system was precise, reliable, and user-friendly. Precision was crucial to avoid any inaccuracies that may occur in the attendance
records, while user information remains a sensitive issue given that face recognition technology handles personal data. This included a discussion on user 
information privacy.

Along with knowledge, this project has assisted me in acquiring skills related to teamwork and communication. While working with my teammates, it was essential
to discuss, share, and work on ideas for our solution. The process of designing and presenting our idea has also assisted me in boosting my confidence related
to presenting and explaining ideas. With this experience, my horizons have been expanded related to using facial recognition technology effectively and 
appropriately within a learning setup, and I appreciate my lecturer and teammates for their assistance.
