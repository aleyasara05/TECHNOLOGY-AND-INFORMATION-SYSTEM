# Project Design Thinking

## Reflection
Undertaking the design thinking project for the development of a face scan system for students has been a very significant learning experience for me. This particular project has helped me gain a further insight into how technology can be used for resolving practical problems associated with campus security and attendance. This particular project has not only helped me gain an understanding of what a face recognition system is all about, but it has also helped me realize how this technology can be used in a positive manner within a schooling environment.

Through this process of design thinking, it was possible for my team to empathize with users, define a problem statement, and design a solution to this problem, taking into consideration functionality and usability. This activity has further enhanced my understanding of the importance of feedback, accuracy, and morality within digital system design.

## Key Learnings
• User-Centred Design: In implementing a system design, I have realized that one needs to understand the needs of the users and the teachers. The accuracy needed in face recognition is a priority; however, in storing or manipulating biometric information that is of a sensitive nature, issues to do with protection also have to be addressed.

• Error of Accuracy and Reliability: One of the things that this project has made me realize as a learner is that system errors could be caused by slight discrepancies in systems.

• Ethical and Privacy Awareness: I have developed an awareness of the ethics involved in the use of facial recognition software and in particular in relation to the themes of consent and privacy.

• Team building and Communication: From my experience with my teammates, I was able to learn to communicate my ideas effectively, give feedback, and work together to achieve a common goal.

• Structured Problem Solving: In design thinking, there is a sequence of steps that I was able to follow to address problems.

## Personal Growth
This project has helped me gain confidence in presenting my ideas and conveying technology concepts. In addition to this, I got the opportunity to learn about responsibility by realizing how technology systems developed by us can influence people directly. This project also has made me considerate and creative in dealing with problems.

## Future Application
Looking ahead, I aim to apply what I learned throughout my process of developing a secure and accurate system with a focus on user experience. This project has motivated me to delve deeper into knowledge related to secure and user-focused tech and apply my skills to solve problems.

## Suggestion For Improvement
For our future project, we can present our ideas in class since it allows us to build confidence and become comfortable when speaking in front of audiences.
