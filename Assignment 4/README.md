# Assignment 4: Overview of ICT Jobs in Industry

From this industry talk, I was able to gain a better insight into the importance of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the real world. From the industry talk, I learned that ICT is not only about coding or developing a system, but it is also about solving business problems, making the system more efficient, and the user experience more enjoyable. There are various roles that are played in the industry, such as the role of the software engineers, developers, designers, and quality assurance, among others, that all come together to make the system more efficient.

From the industry talk, one of the most important things that I learned is that the ICT industry is a dynamic industry. This means that the technology is constantly changing, and therefore, one needs to constantly learn new skills, tools, and technology to remain relevant in the industry. This made me understand the importance of being adaptable in the field of ICT. From the industry talk, I learned the importance of teamwork and communication in the field of ICT, as most of the systems are developed by teams and not individuals.

Overall, this talk about my career has further enhanced my interest in the ICT field and helped me understand the role of ICT in the industry through digital transformation and innovation.
This has further encouraged me to not only develop my skills but also my interpersonal skills so that I have a career in the Information Technology field.
